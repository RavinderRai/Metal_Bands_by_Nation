# Metal Band Subgenres Analysis

An analysis of the popularity of metal subgenres over the years. 
This mini-project makes use of the kaggle dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mrpantherson/metal-by-nation?select=world_population_1960_2015.csv.
The analysis looks at the total number of bands and fans for different subgenres, as a function of time (going through the decades). 
The dataset only contains metal band data from the years 1960-2015.
